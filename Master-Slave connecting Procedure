Steps to Connect Jenkins Slave to Master:
* Login to Jenkins Master (Controller):
* Open your Jenkins dashboard in the browser (e.g., http://<Jenkins_Master_IP>:8080).

Create a New Node (Slave):
* From the Jenkins dashboard, go to Manage Jenkins.
* Select Manage Nodes and Clouds (or Nodes depending on your version).
* Click New Node on the left sidebar.
* Enter the desired name for the node (e.g., sss).
* Select Permanent Agent and click OK.
* Set the Port number for the agent communication (e.g., 40933).
* Click Save to create the node.

Obtain the Agent Connection Command:
* After saving the node configuration, Jenkins will show a command for connecting the slave to the master.
* The command will be in the following format:
-> curl -sO http://<Jenkins_Master_IP>:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar
-> java -jar agent.jar -url http://<Jenkins_Master_IP>:8080/ -secret <secret_key> -name <node_name> -webSocket -workDir "<slave_workdir>"

Verify Connection:
* After running the command, the slave node should connect to the master.
* Go back to Jenkins dashboard, and under Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and, you should see the new node listed as online.
